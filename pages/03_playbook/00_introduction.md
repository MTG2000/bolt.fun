# Playbook

We believe Bitcoin has the potential to change the way we think about money. To fully realise this potential, we need more people from diverse backgrounds to get involved and bring their unique perspectives and skills to the ecosystem.

That's why we're committed to making Bitcoin more attractive to makers around the world. We want to show people that Bitcoin isn't boring, or slow. It's secure, and a platform for creativity, innovation and new opportunities.

However, we know we can't do this alone. That's why we're open sourcing our processes so that others can learn from our experiences and help drive innovation in your local communities. By sharing our knowledge, mistakes, and resources, we hope to empower more people to get involved and contribute to the adoption and growth of Bitcoin.

Remember... FUN is mandatory!
