# An Introduction to Virtual Hackathons

![](https://i.imgur.com/MFmMiLw.png)

Virtual hackathons are online events where participants gather to build products or solve complex problems. Usually, following a specific theme or subject, hackathons are one of the most proven ways to incubate and build great ideas using a targeted technology or stack. At the end of the event, a selected panel of judges (usually industry experts) assesses the projects entered and awards prizes to the teams that build the most successful product or proof of concept. *As youâ€™ll read later, success is a relative term that you get to define as the event organiser.*

Over the past year, BOLTðŸ”©FUN has hosted a number of different sized events that varied in subject, length, and target audience. Throughout these events, we registered > 800 makers on to our platform, incubated 100+ projects and ideas, hosted 60+ workshops and discussions, and distributed over 3.5 BTC (~$65,000) in prizes - onboarding the next wave of bitcoin maker talent. Our most recent event, the Legends of Lightning tournament, was the largest bitcoin hackathon ever run.

In this 4 part guide, we will break down the key details, considerations, and modules you will need to know to run your own successful online hackathon event.
