# Piecing it all together
Once you have come up with ideas for event modules and begun organising them with hosts, you can begin creating your hackathon’s event schedule by dropping these modules into a calendar. Make sure to clearly communicate key event details with participants, as well as to promote and market early. If your event is online, you will also need to decide on a video recording options and software providers, as well as social channels to livestream your content to.

## **Key Event Details**
You will need to decide on the following event details and communicate/market them clearly to your audience:
- Event Name
- Event Date & Time
- Event Host (+ Representing Company)
- Event Link & Streaming Platform (if online)
- Event Description and Series Theme

## **Streaming Software**
If you’re running your event online, it is worth exploring different streaming providers that suit your team’s budget and feature needs. We run our streams through [Streamyard](https://streamyard.com), using their pro plan. This way we can customise our graphics, stream live or recorded videos to multiple social channels (Twitter, YouTube), record content, and host up to 10 unique guests anytime.

## **Display your event schedule online**
Once you have successfully created your hackathon’s event schedule, display it on your event’s homepage and have it visible to any participant looking to take part.
