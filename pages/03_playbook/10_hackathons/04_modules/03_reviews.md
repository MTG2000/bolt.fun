# Design & Code Reviews
Design and code reviews enable teams to form close relationships with a working professional or mentor (or set of mentors) in order to receive feedback on their project. Design reviews enable refinement around UI/UX feedback, formulating user journeys and flows, sketching wireframes, and more. Similarly, code reviews are useful for development teams who are looking to optimise their codebase, unblock an issue, or integrate a particular set of technologies or API requests.

You can run review sessions with an individual or a group. Individual feedback sessions will provide a more direct and focused approach, whilst group feedback might provide participants with a more diverse set of opinions and eyes. If you opt for the latter approach, make sure to have a defined leader of the session to make sure things stay on track.
