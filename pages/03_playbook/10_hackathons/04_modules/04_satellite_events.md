## Community Hosted Satellite Events
Throughout your hackathon, consider putting on different “satellite” events, hosted by either you, companies, or members and meetup groups within your wider community or network. These types of events are better suited to longer format events, and help take some of the organisational pressure and cost off your team.

*Before asking others to host satellite events (workshops, discussions, feedback sessions) on your behalf, we recommend providing straightforward information about your event along with branding and marketing assets, to willing organisers.*

*Some examples of these types of community events include:*

### Twitter Spaces
Bitcoin Twitter is a place where a lot of discussion and outreach takes place. Think about organising online Twitter spaces that allow your participants to engage in open conversation, debate, and idea formation. These are also good for public announcements and key event details, etc.

### Discussions & Webinars
Expand your audience and participation by asking different communities and companies to host online or in-person discussions and seminars.

### Masterclass Workshops
Get different members from your community, willing participants, or external companies and stakeholders to host masterclass workshops for hackers on a specific subject or technology suite.

### Social Meetups
Encourage local bitcoin meetups to organise their own community events and give makers an opportunity to network, discuss ideas, form teams, and begin building their projects.

### Conferences & Hackathons
For larger tournament style events, try to team up with other hackathon or conference organisers in order to cross promote your events. Your participants could learn from conference talks and workshops, or they can even take part in smaller weekend hackathons to help them form teams, generate ideas, incubate and accelerate their projects to achieve a larger goal.
