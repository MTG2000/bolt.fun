# Building Your Hackathon with Modules

![](https://i.imgur.com/bnClCGg.png)

Before you organise your virtual hackathon, you should first sort out what your desired outcomes are. Based on these goals, you can use a varying number of event “modules” to build the core of your online hackathon’s schedule and calendar. Focused mainly around onboarding, education, community engagement and building, event modules will help you stay organised whilst driving up participant engagement and hacking success.

*We split events into 2 categories:*

## **Workshops & Tutorials**
Focused around maker onboarding and education, these types of events provide participants with the skills required to be a successful hacker. Talks and keynotes (conference style) can provide inspiration of ideas, whilst more technical workshops and tutorials dive deeper into applying practical skills and mindsets.

## **Community Hosted Satellite Events**
During our longer format hackathons (tournaments), we provide different community members and groups the opportunity to host their own “satellite” events. This encourages local engagement and community ownership during remote events, whilst continuing education and onboarding efforts.
